Code for the generation of non-planar auxetic meshes./Codigo para generacion de mallas auxeticas no planas
All code developed and lovingly commented by John McCaw.

# Project Description
This is the Repository for all code worked on for the non-planar auxetic meshes project. There are two methods described here; (a) Using just the MATLAB for the generation of GCODE for non-planar meshes, and (b) using an ungodly concoction of SolidWorks, Excel, and the MATLAB. I know this commits the sin of maintaining .m files in a text editor, but, alas, gotta put it all somewhere neatly. Following is a brief summary of what files you can expect.

# Part (a)
- Solidworks macro files
  - These are written in VBA for execution in SolidWorks. Syntax is finicky, edit at your own risk.
  - PointToExcel.swp: This is the one bit of code I didn't write, was found in an online SolidWorks forum.
